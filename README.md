# two-ways-communication-betwen-R-and-Python

This project aims to show how to achieve two-way communication between R and Python using the reticulate package in the R markdown.

I demonstrated my deep understanding of R and Python programming languages in this project.

Using this way, We can keep the convenience of both programming languages.
